    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The real-world problem that this project aims to solve is the need to provide advice to homeowners about how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount. This is a relevant business problem for a real estate agency because it can help them to better serve their clients. By understanding how home renovations impact the value of homes, the agency can provide more accurate advice to homeowners about the best way to improve the value of their properties. This can lead to more sales for the agency, as well as happier clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stakeholders\n",
    "The main stakeholders who could use this project are real estate agents, homeowners, and home improvement contractors. Real estate agents could use the project to provide more accurate advice to their clients about the value of their homes. Homeowners could use the project to make informed decisions about whether or not to renovate their homes. And home improvement contractors could use the project to identify the most profitable renovations to offer their clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The project has the potential to make a significant impact on the real-world problem of understanding how home renovations impact the value of homes. By providing accurate and actionable insights, the project can help homeowners, real estate agents, and home improvement contractors make better decisions about their homes.\n"

    "Sale Price: The price at which the home was sold.\n",
    "Square Footage: The total square footage of the home.\n",
    "Number of Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the home.\n",
    "Number of Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the home.\n",
    "Year Built: The year the home was built.\n",
    "Neighborhood: The neighborhood where the home is located.\n",
    "Renovation Type: The type of renovation that was done, if any.\n",
    "Renovation Cost: The cost of the renovation, if any.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sale Price: This is the dependent variable that we are trying to predict.\n",
    "Renovation Type: This is a categorical variable that indicates the type of renovation that was done, such as a kitchen remodel, a bathroom remodel, or an addition.\n",
    "Renovation Cost: This is a continuous variable that indicates the cost of the renovation.\n",
    "Square Footage: This is a continuous variable that indicates the size of the home.\n",
    "Number of Bedrooms: This is a categorical variable that indicates the number of bedrooms in the home.\n",
    "Number of Bathrooms: This is a categorical variable that indicates the number of bathrooms in the home.\n",
    "Year Built: This is a continuous variable that indicates the year the home was built.\n",
    "## Limitations of the Data\n",
    "The following are some limitations of the data that have implications for the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is from King County, Washington, so it may not be generalizable to other areas.\n",
    "The data is from 2014 to 2017, so it may not be up-to-date.\n",
    "The data is self-reported, so there may be errors or omissions."
